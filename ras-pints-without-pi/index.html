			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>If you're a brewer, home or otherwise, you may have heard about the excellent project <a href="http://raspberrypints.com">RaspberryPints</a>,
			a software package for the RaspberryPi that allows you to display your tap list on a large-screen TV for your friends and/or customers to
			view quickly and at a glance, adding a touch of class and elegance to your beloved brewery:</p>

				<figcaption>source: raspberrypints.com</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>I was inspired to write this howto when a fellow homebrewer inquired about running the software without RaspberryPi, using his tablet 
			instead of a TV screen. At first we were spitballing solutions like setting up an X11 tunnel over SSH to an emulated Pi using 
			<a href="http://xecdesign.com/qemu-emulating-raspberry-pi-the-easy-way/">QEMU</a>, but I decided to take a look at the 
			<a href="https://github.com/RaspberryPints/RaspberryPints">source code</a> to see if there was an easier way. Turns out it's just
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">PHP over MySQL</a>, which means it should run on a desktop computer
			just as easily and display in a mobile browser with few issues.</p>
			<p>(It also means with a little bit of tweaking, I could plug in some jQuery extensions to enhance the site with touch screen
			capabilities. Draw a pint, tap the screen, update my inventory. Coooool. But first things first, let's finish this howto.)</p>
			<p>By the end of this howto, you should be up and running with RaspberryPints without the overhead of purchasing additional hardware.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="ingredients">
			<h1>You will need:</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>A computer with an internet connection - this will be your server</li>
				<li>A wifi network</li>
				<li>A dedicated tablet - Android, iPad, Kindle, Windows 8, whatever</li>
				<li>Enough technical knowhow to install and configure a web server on a desktop computer</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

			<h1>Step 1</h1>
			<h2>Install a Web Server With PHP and MySQL</h2>
			<h3>(aka: <a href="http://xkcd.com/353/">import antigravity</a>)</h3>
			<p>Let me apologize for the handwaving in this section.</p>
			<p>I will try to make no assumptions as to your skill level. However, I also can't make any assumptions as to what platform you're using.
			Rather than cover every platform, I'll just say that I used <a href="http://vanbosse.be/blog/detail/a-homebrew-lamp-stack">this</a> tutorial
			successfully on a Mac, and offer you some links that should work on other platforms:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Windows:</strong> <a href="http://www.neothermic.com/tutorials/ApacheTutorial.php">How to Install Apache, MySQL and PHP on a Windows System</a></li>
				<li><strong>Mac OS X:</strong> <a href="http://vanbosse.be/blog/detail/a-homebrew-lamp-stack">A Homebrew LAMP stack</a></li>
				<li><strong>Ubuntu:</strong> <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP">ApacheMySQLPHP</a></li>
				<li><strong>Other Linux:</strong> <em>If you're smart enough to be running anything else as your OS, you're smart enough to do this step on your own, cowboy.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Important: Make a note of all passwords and directories at this stage; you'll need them later!</strong></p>
			<h3>Hints</h3>
			<p>Here are some notes that may help you complete the above tutorials:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On a Mac, the final location of your PHP binary ("libphp5.so") may differ, so it's very important that you tell Apache the
				correct location. The installer will give you the exact line to type, so watch the output carefully. You can also use the following 
				terminal command to search your computer for this file:
				<code>sudo find / -type f -name 'libphp5.so' 2>/dev/null</code></li>
				<li>On a Mac, the MySQL installer does not start the database automatically, and the command in the tutorial to update the MySQL password
				will not work until you start the service. This command will start the database for you:
				<code>mysql.server start</code></li>
				<li>Use this command on Mac/Linux to restart the Apache server if you have issues with the configuration:
				<code>sudo apachectl restart</code></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div id="install-git">
			<h1>Step 2</h1>
			<h2>Install a Git client</h2>
			<p>The handwaving ends after this step, I promise.</p>
			<p>I'm a software developer, so having a computer without a git client is almost as ludicrous to me as having one without a web browser.
			That said, I understand you may not be so technically inclined. <em>Un</em>fortunately, git is probably the easiest way for you to get at
			the RaspberryPints source code. <em>Fortunately</em>, the "git guys" have already helped me out with a good howto on this, and it covers
			the same platforms as above:</p>
			<p><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Getting Started Installing Git</a></p>
			<p>Go follow the link above and come back here when you're done.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="get-the-software">
			<h1>Step 3</h1>
			<h2>Get ("git") the application</h2>
			<p>Now it's time to grab the source code. Assuming the above two steps are done, this is all you need to do:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open a command prompt.</li>
				<li>Change directories to the document root for Apache as installed in step 1 (for me, this was /Library/WebServer/Documents)</li>
				<li>Type the following command<sup><a href="#note1" id="note1-return">1</a> <a href="#note2" id="note2-return">2</a></sup>: <code>sudo git clone https://github.com/RaspberryPints/RaspberryPints</code></li>
			</ol>
			<p>That's it! You now have RaspberryPints on your computer. We still need to set it up before we can use it, however.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="setting-up">
			<h1>Step 4</h1>
			<h2>Setting up RaspberryPints</h2>
			<p>Assuming all has gone well up to this point, simply open a browser and point it at <a href="http://localhost/RaspberryPints/install" target="_blank">http://localhost/RaspberryPints/install</a>. You should see the following page or something similar:</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./img/pints-install.png" />
			</figure>
			<p>Step 1 lets RaspberryPints connect to MySQL and install your "beers" database. Use the root password you set up in Step 1 of <em>this</em> howto.</p>
			<p>Step 2 installs the "beers" database. These can be anything and you probably won't ever use them directly.</p>
			<p>Step 3 sets up your administrator account. This is the password you'll be using to modify your beer inventory behind the scenes.</p>
			<p>Check "Load sample data" if you want to start with sample beers already loaded in the system. You can override these later.</p>
			<p>Click "Setup!" You will see an info page telling you the installation was successful. Navigate to <a href="http://localhost/RaspberryPints">http://localhost/RaspberryPints</a> to confirm.</p>
			<p>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost/RaspberryPints/admin">http://localhost/RaspberryPints/admin</a> and enter the administrator account information to set up your tap list and brewery logo.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="tablet-access">
			<h1>Step 5</h1>
			<h2>Viewing RaspberryPints on a tablet</h2>
			<p>Congratulations, you have installed RaspberryPints on non-RaspberryPi hardware. You little rebel you.</p>
			<p>Now, for the part that this was all for, setting up a tablet to display RaspberryPints. First, you need to figure out the <em>local IP</em>
			of the computer you installed RaspberryPints on. In a command terminal, type the following if you are on a Mac or Linux:<code>ifconfig</code>
			and this if you are on Windows:<code>ipconfig /all</code></p>
			<p>You are looking for a line that says "inet" or "inet addr" (on Linux/Mac) or "IP Address" (Windows).
			If you are running on Linux or a Mac and are having a hard time sorting through all the information this command belches out, the following command will help you sort through the uninteresting information:
			<code>ifconfig |grep inet</code></p>
			<figure>
				<img src="./img/ifconfig-output-annotated.png" />
				<figcaption>Sample output of the above command with possible IP addresses highlighted. This will look very different on Windows. Note that there are
				multiple possibilities, so I had to try multiple addresses on my tablet to get it to work. Ignore 127.0.0.1 as it is never an external IP address.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>When you have found the line that says "inet" or "IP Address", then look for a set of four 1-3 digit numbers separated by periods. This is your local IP address. Write this number down. If there are multiple
			addresses, start with the first one and work your way down the list. <em>(But ignore 127.0.0.1. This is never an externally valid IP; it is how 
			all computers refer to themselves.)</em></p>
			<p>Next, open your preferred browser app on your tablet. In the address bar, type "http://&lt;IP_ADDRESS&gt;/RaspberryPints", replacing &lt;IP_ADDRESS&gt;
			with the address you just wrote down. (Again, you may have to try a few to get this step right.) If all goes well, you should see the RaspberryPints application on your tablet:</p>
			<figure><img src="./img/tablet-with-taps.jpg" style="width:80%" /><figcaption>In all its digital goodness... It will look better once I get it mounted!</figcaption></figure>
			<figure><img src="./img/tablet-close-up.jpg" style="width:80%" /><figcaption>A better view - excuse the poor quality Galaxy S3 camera!</figcaption></figure>
			<p>Congrats! You now have a snazzy digital taplist for display in your brewery, and you didn't have to spend a nickel on specialized hardware.
			Remember that you can administer this page from <a href="http://localhost/RaspberryPints/admin">http://localhost/RaspberryPints/admin</a> on
			your desktop, and it will update remotely.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Important Note:</em></strong> Depending on your wifi hardware, your IP address may change periodically. If you ever find that
			you cannot view RaspberryPints on your tablet but you can view it via the "localhost" link above, repeat this step.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="additional-stuff">
			<h1>Additional Stuff</h1>
			<p>Now that you have RaspberryPints up and running, you will probably want to do things like run the browser in fullscreen mode, keep the screen
			from dimming and turning off automatically, set up static DHCP for your computer, etc. Unfortunately, since all tablets and wifi routers are 
			different, this is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but for completeness, you will probably want to do these things anyway. 
			Just remember: Google is your friend. Good luck!</p>

			<h1>Notes</h1>
			<ol>
				<li id="note1"><a href="#note1-return">^</a>Note that if you are running in Windows, you will not need "sudo" - this is there to override user privileges
				on Linux/Unix and Mac systems. Instead, your command will be: <code>git clone https://github.com/RaspberryPints/RaspberryPints</code></li>
				<li id="note2"><a href="#note2-return">^</a>On Linux/Unix and Mac systems, this will grant ownership to root. You may need to change ownership to the HTTP daemon user.
				On Mac OS X this is _www and on Ubuntu it is usually apache. After downloading the source, use the following command for a Mac: <code>sudo chown -R _www RaspberryPints/</code> and use this for Ubuntu: <code>sudo chown -R apache RaspberryPints/</code></li>
